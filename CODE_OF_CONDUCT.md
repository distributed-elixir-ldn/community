# Distributed Elixir London Code of Conduct

Adapted from [Underland's Code of Conduct](https://underland.xyz/conduct).

We (the organisers) believe that everyone involved in the Distributed Elixir
London community has the right to be in a safe and welcoming environment. This
Code of Conduct is about creating an open and welcoming environment within our
community and at our events so that everyone feels able to participate while
being safe and happy

People can have lots of viewpoints, and being part of the community involves:

- Committing to helping each other
- Listening to others views
- Setting an example
- Treating everyone equally
- Respecting your environment and the people around you


## What is not acceptable

To represent yourself to your very best ability, you must always practice:

- No violence
- No harassment
- No discrimination
- No inappropriate imagery or content

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments
related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what
youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment
and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Community members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.  Absolutely everyone involved with our activities are subject to
our Code of Conduct.

If a person engages in any harassing behaviour, we may take any action we deem
appropriate, including (but not limited to) warnings, expulsion from an event,
and banning.


## What we won't respond to

Our community priotizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's
comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- Reverse-isms, including reverse racism, reverse sexism, and cisphobia.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you"
- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial
- Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

We expect people to follow these rules on GitHub, Gitter, and all community
events.


## Need to report bad behaviour?

For now please message me on Gitter, email me at me@cgmcintyre.com, or come
talk to me at an event.
